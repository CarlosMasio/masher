# Local Hash Generator Tool

A simple CLI tool built with Node.js to generate **MD5** and **SHA1** hashes locally. This tool allows you to input text, and it will return the corresponding MD5 and SHA1 hashes without relying on external websites.

---

## Features

- **MD5 Hash Generation**: Generate MD5 hashes from any input string.
- **SHA1 Hash Generation**: Generate SHA1 hashes from any input string.
- **No External Dependencies**: Operates entirely offline with the built-in Node.js `crypto` module.
- **Simple CLI Interface**: Easily use the tool via the terminal.

---

## Requirements

- **Node.js**: The tool requires Node.js (version 12 or later) to run.

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/local-hash-generator.git
cd local-hash-generator
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

This tool uses the built-in Node.js `crypto` module, so no additional dependencies are needed.

---

## Usage

### 1. Run the Tool

In your terminal, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
node local-hash-generator.js
```

### 2. Enter the Text to Hash

The script will prompt you to enter the text you want to hash.

```
ENTER TEXT TO HASH:
```

### 3. View the Results

Once you enter the text, the script will output the **MD5** and **SHA1** hashes:

```
--- HASH RESULTS ---
MD5 : <md5-hash>
SHA1: <sha1-hash>
```

---

## Example

```bash
$ node local-hash-generator.js
ENTER TEXT TO HASH: Hello World
--- HASH RESULTS ---
MD5 : b94d27b9934d3e08a52e52d7da7dabf3
SHA1: 2ef7bde608ce5404e97d5f042f95f89f1c232871
```
